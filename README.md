# 🐶 Dog Breeds
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5.1.1-orange.svg)](https://swift.org)

A test project in which I render the data retrieved from the dog.ceo API.

In it, I want to focus on using the UITableView and UICollectionView based interfaces.

## 🎉 Why am I building this?
1. The most common interview task is to get data on the API, display it in a table, do something with the data ... This project is a reflection of my current skills in working with such tasks.
1. When writing a project, I spontaneously use the libraries I like: [`SwiftEntryKit`](https://github.com/huri000/SwiftEntryKit), [`SVProgressHUD`](https://github.com/SVProgressHUD/SVProgressHUD). Because I liked them and I am pleased to train with them 😃
1. I love dogs. Dogs are cool 😎
